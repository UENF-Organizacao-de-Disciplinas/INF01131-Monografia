  abstract  = "Gain a broad understanding of how PCI DSS is structured and
               obtain a high-level view of the contents and context of each of
               the 12 top-level requirements. The guidance provided in this
               book will help you effectively apply PCI DSS in your business
               environments, enhance your payment card defensive posture, and
               reduce the opportunities for criminals to compromise your
               network or steal sensitive data assets. Businesses are seeing an
               increased volume of data breaches, where an opportunist attacker
               from outside the business or a disaffected employee successfully
               exploits poor company practices. Rather than being a
               regurgitation of the PCI DSS controls, this book aims to help
               you balance the needs of running your business with the value of
               implementing PCI DSS for the protection of consumer payment card
               data. Applying lessons learned from history, military
               experiences (including multiple deployments into hostile areas),
               numerous PCI QSA assignments, and corporate cybersecurity and
               InfoSec roles, author Jim Seaman helps you understand the
               complexities of the payment card industry data security standard
               as you protect cardholder data. You will learn how to align the
               standard with your business IT systems or operations that store,
               process, and/or transmit sensitive data. This book will help you
               develop a business cybersecurity and InfoSec strategy through
               the correct interpretation, implementation, and maintenance of
               PCI DSS. What You Will Learn Be aware of recent data privacy
